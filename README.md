_Right click in the parts window and select "Import" to install new parts into Fritzing_

### Step-by-Step Installation Instructions:

1. Download this repository
2. Open Fritzing
3. Go to "My Parts" in the parts browser
4. Right-click the panel and select "Import" (see image above) 
5. Select LIDARLite-Fritzing-Part.fzpz and click "Open"
6. When you close Fritzing after working with it, it will ask you "Do you want to keep the imported parts?" click "Yes". 
7. Another pop-up will appear asking "Do you want to save the changes you made in the bin "My Parts"?" click "Save"and the LIDAR-Lite will now be part of your parts library until you delete it. 

_NOTE: While the second pop-up seems redundant, you have the ability to not only import, but modify parts. This second window is a catch for modifications to the parts library where the first window is concerned with additions to the library._




## SVG

Fritzing parts are created with SVGs. They are included in case there is any need to work with them directly, they are not required for installing or usage of the Fritzing part.
